The Zeppelins Over London
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Richard Aldington</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
... The war saps all one’s energy. It seems impossible to do
any creative work in the midst of all this turmoil and carnage. Of course
you know that we had the Zeppelins over London? Let me give you my
version of the affair.
</p>

<p>
It was just after eleven. We were sitting in our little flat, which is on
the top floor of a building on the slope of Hampstead Hill. We were reading—I
was savouring, like a true decadent, that over-sweet honied Latin
of the early Renaissance in an edition of 1513! Could anything be more
peaceful? Our window was shut—so the silence was absolute. Suddenly
there was a Bang! and a shrill wail. “That was pretty close,” said I.
Bang—whizz! Bang—whizz! Shrapnel from the anti-aircraft guns which
are not five hundred yards from our house! (Of course, like boobies, we
thought they were bombs.) I jumped up and got my coat, and grabbed the
door-key. It took hours to put out the light! (All the time Bang—whizz!)
It seemed interminable, that descent of those four flights of stairs, all the
time with the knowledge that any second might see the whole damn place
blown to hell. We could see the flashes of the guns and the searchlights
as we passed the windows—<em>they were pointed straight at us</em>! That meant
that the Zeppelin was either right overhead or coming there! Some excitement,
I tell you. I shiver with excitement when I think of it. We stood
at the porch for a few seconds—very long seconds—wondering what to do.
You are supposed to get into the cellars, but we haven’t got cellars; and
it’s very risky in the streets from the flying shrapnel. We could see the
long searchlights pointing to a spot almost overhead and the little red pinpricks
of bursting shells. A man came down from one of the flats—very
calm, with field glasses, to have a look at the animal! Suddenly we saw it,
clear over head, with shells from three <a id="corr-0"></a>or four guns making little rose-coloured
punctures in the air underneath it. One shell went near, very
near, the Zeppelin swerved, tilted—“They’ve got it! It’s coming down!”
we all exclaimed. In the distance we could hear faint cheering. But the
Zeppelin righted itself, waggled a little, and scenting danger made for the
nearest cloud! Apparently a piece of shell had hit the pilot, for there was
no apparent damage to be seen through the glasses. There were a few
more bangs from the guns, followed by the cat squeals of the shells and
the little explosions in the air. Then silence as the Zeppelin got into a
cloud; the searchlights looked wildly for it, for ten minutes. Then they
all went out and in the resulting darkness we could see the glow of the
fires in London.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
What rather detracts from our heroism is the fact that the Zeppelin
had already dropped all its bombs in the middle of London, but we didn’t
know it till afterwards.
</p>

<p>
I deduce these reflections. 1. That as an engine of frightfulness the
Zeppelin is over-rated. And the damage it does is comparatively unimportant.
2. That it is uncultured of the Germans to risk murdering the
English Imagists and ruining the only poetic movement in England, for the
sake of getting their names into the papers. 3. That I notice I never go to
bed now earlier than twelve, and frequently go for a walk about eleven
o’clock.
</p>

<p>
I can’t of course tell you where the bombs fell, as it is strictly forbidden.
Still I can say this: that no public building of any kind was touched; that
it looks jolly well as if our Teutonic friends made a dead set at St. Paul’s
and the British Museum; that, without exception, the bombs fell on the
houses of the poor and the very poor—except for a warehouse or so and
some offices; that one bomb fell near a block of hospitals, containing paralytics
and other cripples and diseased persons, smashed all the hospital
windows, and terrified the unhappy patients into hysterics; that, lastly, it
is a damned lie to say there are guns on St. Paul’s and the British
Museum—the buildings are too old to stand the shock of the recoil. Voilà!
</p>

<p>
... Remy de Gourmont is dead.... Camille de Saint-Croix
also. It is hard to write of friends recently dead....

does not shrink from diluting them with
clear water).—<em>Romain Rolland.</em>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> estimating the intrinsic value of a book like <em>The “Genius”</em> and—generally—of
a writer like Theodore Dreiser, it is advisable to indulge in a
little gentle introspection.
</p>

<p>
Criticism need not always impose itself as an art; but it must at least
conform to some of the principles that govern that form of human activity.
The worthlessness of so much energetic modern criticism is that it proceeds—like
scum—from the mere surface of the writer’s intelligence. It is true
that all criticism resolves itself ultimately into a matter of taste;—but one
has to discover what one’s taste really is; and that is not always easy.
</p>

<p>
Taste is a living thing, an organic thing. It submits to the laws of
growth; and its growth is fostered or retarded by many extraneous influences.
In regard to the appreciation of new and original works of art, it
belongs to the inherent nature of taste that it should be enlarged, transmuted,
and undergo the birth-pangs of a species of re-creation. In the presence
of a work of art that is really unusual, in an attempt to appreciate a
literary effect that has never appeared before, one’s taste necessarily suffers
a certain embarrassment and uneasiness. It suffers indeed sometimes a
quite extreme discomfort. This is inevitable. This is right. This means
that the creative energy in the new thing is getting to work upon us, unloosening
our prejudices and enlarging our scope. Such a process is
attended by exquisite intellectual excitement. It is also attended by a certain
rending and tearing of personal vanity.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
One is too apt to confuse the existing synthesis of one’s aesthetic instincts
with the totality of one’s being; and this is a fatal blunder; for who
can fathom the reach of <em>that</em> circumference? And it is of the nature of all
syntheses to change and grow.
</p>

<p>
Yet, on the other hand, nothing is more ridiculous and ineffective than
the kind of hand-to-mouth criticism which attempts to eliminate its own
past, and to snatch at the glow and glamour of a work of art, as it were
“<em>de vacuo</em>,” and out of misty clouds. If one wishes to catch the secret of
true criticism; if one’s criticism is to be something more than a mere howl
of senseless condemnation or yawp of still more senseless praise; one must
attempt to do what Goethe and Saint-Beuve and Brandes and Pater were
always doing: that is to say, to make every use of every tradition, <em>our own</em>,
as well as that of classical authority;—and then carry all this a little, just
a little, <em>further</em>; giving it the shudder and the thrilling interest of the
process of organic growth.
</p>

<p>
Without tradition, the tradition of our own determined taste and the
tradition of classical taste, there can be no growth. Oracles uttered in neglect
of these, are oracles “<em>in vacuo</em>,” without meaning or substance; without
roots in human experience. Whether we are pleased to acknowledge it or
not, our own gradually-evolved taste is linked at a thousand points with the
classical taste of the ages. In criticizing new work we can no more afford
to neglect such tradition than, in expressing our thoughts, we can afford
to neglect language.
</p>

<p>
Tradition <em>is</em> the language of criticism. It can be carried further: every
original work of art, by producing a new reaction upon it, necessarily carries
it further. But it cannot be swept aside; or we are reduced to dumbness;
to such vague growls and gestures as animals might indulge in. Criticism,
to carry any intelligible meaning at all, must use the language provided
by the centuries. There is no other language to use; and in default
of language we are reduced, as I have said, to inarticulate noises.
</p>

<p>
The unfortunate thing is, that much of the so-called “criticism” of our
day is nothing better than such <em>physiological gesticulation</em>. In criticism, as
in life, a certain degree of <em>continuity</em> is necessary, or we become no more
than arbitrary puffs of wind, who may shriek one day down the chimney,
and another day through a crack in the door, but in neither case with any
intelligible meaning for human ears.
</p>

<p>
In dealing with a creative quality as unusual and striking as that of
Theodore Dreiser, it is of absolutely no critical value to content ourselves
with a crude physical disturbance on the surface of our minds, whether such
disturbance is favourable or unfavourable to the writer. It is, for instance,
quite irrelevant to hurl condemnation upon a work like <em>The “Genius”</em> because
it is largely preoccupied with sex. It is quite equally irrelevant to
lavish enthusiastic laudations upon it because of this preoccupation. A
work of art is not good because it speaks daringly and openly about things
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
that shock certain minds. It is not bad because it avoids all mention of
such things. An artist has a right to introduce into his work what he
pleases and to exclude from his work what he pleases. The question for
the critic is, not what subject has he selected, but how has he treated that
subject;—has he made out of it an imaginative, suggestive, and convincing
work of art, or has he not! There is no other issue before the critic than
this; and if he supposes there is,—if he supposes he has the smallest authority
to dictate to a writer what his subject shall be;—he is simply making a
fool of himself.
</p>

<p>
There is an absurd tendency among some of us to suppose that a writer
is necessarily a great writer because he is daring in his treatment of sex.
This is quite as grotesque an illusion as the opposite one, that a great writer
must be idealistic and uplifting. There is not the remotest reason why he
should concern himself with sex; if he prefers—as did Charles Dickens for
instance—to deal with other aspects of life. On the other hand there is not
the least reason why he should be “uplifting.” Let him be an artist—an
artist—that is the important matter! All these questions concerning “subjects”
are tedious and utterly trifling.
</p>

<p>
In <em>The “Genius”</em> Theodore Dreiser has achieved a very curious and a
very original work. In doing it he has once more made it clear how much
more interesting the quality of his own genius is than that of any other
American novelist of the present age.
</p>

<p>
<em>The “Genius”</em> is an epic work. It has the epic rather than the dramatic
quality; it has the epic rather than the mystic, or symbolic, quality. And
strictly speaking, Dreiser’s novels, especially the later ones, are the only
novels in America, are the only novels, as a matter of fact, in England or
America, which possess this quality. It is quite properly in accordance
with the epic attitude of mind, with the epic quality in art, this reduction of
the more purely human episodes to a proportionate insignificance compared
with the general surge and volume of the life-stream. It is completely in
keeping with the epic quality that there should be no far-fetched psychology,
no quivering suspensions on the verge of the unknown.
</p>

<p>
Dreiser is concerned with the mass and weight of the stupendous life-tide;
the life-tide as it flows forward, through vast panoramic stretches of
cosmic scenery. Both in respect to human beings, and in respect to his
treatment of inanimate objects, this is always what most dominatingly interests
him. You will not find in Dreiser’s books those fascinating arrests of
the onward-sweeping tide, those delicate pauses and expectancies, in back-waters
and enclosed gardens, where persons, with diverting twists in their
brains, murmur and meander at their ease, protected from the great stream.
Nobody in the Dreiser-world is so protected; nobody is so privileged. The
great stream sweeps them all forward, sweeps them all away; and not they,
but <em>It</em>, must be regarded as the hero of the tale.
</p>

<p>
It is precisely this quality, this subordination of the individual to the
deep waters that carry him, which makes Dreiser so peculiarly the American
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
writer. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why he has had a more profoundly
appreciative hearing in England than in the United States. It was
so with Walt Whitman in his earlier days. To get the adequate perspective
for a work so entirely epical it seems necessary to have the Atlantic as a
modifying foreground. Americans—so entirely <em>in it</em> themselves—are naturally,
unless they possess the Protean faculty of the editor of Reedy’s
<em>Mirror</em>, unable to see the thing in this cosmic light. They are misled by
certain outstanding details—the sexual scenes, for instance; or the financial
scenes,—and are prevented by these, as by the famous “Catalogues” in
Whitman, from getting the proportionate vision.
</p>

<p>
The true literary descendants of the author of the <em>Leaves of Grass</em> are
undoubtedly Theodore Dreiser and Edgar Masters. These two, and these
two alone, though in completely different ways, possess that singular “beyond-good-and-evil”
touch which the epic form of art requires. It was just
the same with Homer and Vergil, who were as naturally the epic children
of aristocratic ages, as these are of a democratic one.
</p>

<p>
Achilles is not really a very attractive figure—take him all in all; and
we remember how scandalously Æneas behaved to Dido. The ancient epic
writers, writing for an aristocracy, caught the world-stream from a poetic
angle. The modern epic writers, writing for a democracy, catch it from a
realistic one. But it is the same world-stream; and in accordance with the
epic vision there is the same subordination of the individual to the cosmic
tide. This is essentially a dramatic, rather than an epic epoch, and that is
why so many of us are bewildered and confused by the Dreiser method.
</p>

<p>
<em>The “Genius”</em> is a long book. But it might have been three times as
long. It might begin anywhere and stop anywhere. It is the Prose-Iliad of
the American Scene; and, like that other, it has a right to cut out its segment
of the shifting panorama at almost any point.
</p>

<p>
And so with the style of the thing. It is a ridiculous mis-statement for
critics to say that Dreiser has no style. It is a charming irony, on his own
part, to belittle his style. He has, as a matter of fact, a very definite and
a very effective style. It is a style that lends itself to the huge indifferent
piling up of indiscriminate materials, quite as admirably as that gracious
poetical one of the old epic-makers lent itself to their haughtier and more
aristocratic purpose. One would recognize a page of Dreiser’s writings as
infallibly as one would recognize a page of Hardy’s. The former <em>relaxes</em>
his medium to the extreme limit and the latter <em>tightens</em> his; but they both
have their “manner.” A paragraph written by Dreiser would never be
mistaken for anyone else’s. If for no other peculiarity Dreiser’s style is
remarkable for the shamelessness with which it adapts itself to the drivel
of ordinary conversation. In the Dreiser books—especially in the later
ones, where in my humble opinion he is feeling more firmly after his true
way,—people are permitted to say those things which they actually do say
in real life—things that make you blush and howl, so soaked in banality and
ineptitude are they. In the true epic manner Dreiser gravely puts down
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
all these fatuous observations, until you feel inclined to cry aloud for the
maddest, the most fantastic, the most affected Osconian wit, to serve as an
antidote.

But one knows very well he is right. People don’t in ordinary life—certainly
not in ordinary democratic life—talk like Oscar Wilde, or utter
deep ironic sayings in the style of Matthew Arnold. They don’t really—let
this be well understood—concentrate their feelings in bitter pungent
spasmodic outbursts, as those Rabelaisean persons in Guy de Maupassant.
They just gabble and gibber and drivel; at least that is what they do in
England and America. The extraordinary language which the lovers in
Dreiser—we use the term “lovers” in large sense—use to one another
might well make an aesthetic-minded person howl with nervous rage. But
then,—and who does not know it?—the obsession of the sex-illusion is
above everything else a thing that makes idiots of people; a thing that
makes them talk like Simple Simons. In real life lovers don’t utter those
wonderful pregnant sayings which leap to their lips in our subtle symbolic
dramas. They just burble and blather and blurt forth whatever drivelling
nonsense comes into their heads. Dreiser is the true master of the modern
American Prose-Epic just because he is not afraid of the weariness, the
staleness, the flatness, and unprofitableness of actual human conversation.
In reading the great ancient poetic epics one is amazed at the “naivete”
with which these haughty persons—these gods and demi-gods express their
emotional reactions. It is “carried off,” of course, there, by the sublime
heightening of the style; but it produces just the same final impression,—of
the insignificance of the individual, whether mortal or immortal, compared
with the torrent of Fate which sweeps them all along.
</p>

<p>
And the same thing applies to Dreiser’s attitude towards “good and
evil” and towards the problem of the “supernatural.” All other modern
writers array themselves on this side or that. They either defend traditional
morality or they attack it. They are anxious, at all costs, to give
their work dramatic intensity; they struggle to make it ironical, symbolical,
mystical—God knows what! But Dreiser neither attacks morality nor
defends immorality. In the true Epic manner he puts himself aside, and
permits the great mad Hurly-Burly to rush pell-mell past him and write its
own whirligig runes at its own careless pleasure. Even Zola himself was
not such a realist. Zola had a purpose;—the purpose of showing what a
Beast the human animal is! Dreiser’s people are not beasts; and they shock
our aesthetic sensibilities quite as often by their human sentiment as they
do by their lapses into lechery.
</p>

<p>
To a European mind there is something incredibly absurd in the notion
that these Dreiser books are immoral.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the majority of French and Russian writers Dreiser is not interested
in the pathology of vice. He is too deeply imbued with the great
naive epic spirit to stop and linger in these curious bye-paths. He holds
Nature—in her normal moods—to be sufficiently remarkable.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
It is the same with his attitude towards the “supernatural.” The American
Prose-Epic were obviously false to reality if the presence of the supernatural
were not felt. It is felt and felt very powerfully; but it is kept in
its place. Like Walt Whitman’s stellar constellations, it suffices for those
who belong to it, it is right enough where it is—we do not want it any
nearer!
</p>

<p>
Because the much-tossed wanderer, Eugene Witla, draws a certain
consolation, at the last, from Christian Science, only a very literal person
would accuse the author of <em>The “Genius”</em> of being a convert to the faith.
To omit Christian Science from any prose-epic of American life would be
to falsify the picture out of personal prejudice. Dreiser has no prejudices
except the prejudice of finding the normal man and the normal woman,
shuffled to and fro by the normal forces of life, an interesting and arresting
spectacle. To some among us such a spectacle is not interesting. We must
have the excitement of the unusual, the shock of the abnormal. Well!
There are plenty of European writers ready to gratify this taste. Dreiser
is not a European writer. He is an American writer. The life that interests
him, and interests him passionately, is the life of America. It remains to
be seen whether the life of America interests Americans!
</p>

<p>
It is really quite important to get the correct point of view with regard
to Dreiser’s “style.” The <em>negative</em> qualities in this style of his are indeed
as important as the positive ones. He is so epical, so objective, so concrete
and indifferent, that he is quite content when the great blocked-out masses
of his work lift themselves from the obscure womb of being and take shape
before him. When they have done this,—when these piled-up materials and
portentous groups of people have limned themselves against the grey background,—he
himself stands aside, like some dim demiurgic forger in the
cosmic blast-furnace, and mutters queer commentaries upon what he sees.
He utters these commentaries through the lips of his characters—Cowperwood,
say, or Witla—or even some of the less important ones;—and broken
and incoherent enough they are!
</p>

<p>
But what matter! The huge epic canvas is stretched out there before
us. The vast cyclopean edifice lifts its shadowy bulk towards the grey
sky. The thing has been achieved. The creative spirit has breathed upon
the waters. Resting from his titanic labor, what matter if this Demiurge
drowses, and with an immense humorous indifference permits his characters
to nod too, and utter strange words in their dreams!
</p>

<p>
The carelessness of Dreiser’s style, its large indolence, its contempt for
epigrammatic point, its relaxed strength, is not really a defect at all when
you regard his work from the epic view-point.
</p>

<p>
There must be something in a great cosmic picture to take the place
of the sand and silt and rubbish and rubble which we know so well in life,
under the grey sky! And these stammered incoherences, these broken mutterings,
fill in this gap. They give the picture that drab patience, that
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
monotonous spaciousness which is required. Symbolic drama or psychological
fiction can dispense with these blank surfaces. The prose-epic of America
cannot afford to do without them. They suggest that curious sadness—the
sadness of large, flat, featureless scenery, which visitors from Europe
find so depressing.
</p>

<p>
Well! Thus it remains. If one is interested in the “urge—urge—urge,”
as Whitman calls it, of the normal life-stream as it goes upon its
way, in these American States, one reads Dreiser with a strange pleasure.
He is no more moral than the normal life-stream is moral; and he is no
more immoral. It is true the normal life-stream does not cover <em>quite</em> the
whole field. There <em>are</em> back-waters and there <em>are</em> enclosed gardens.
</p>

<p>
There was a Europe once. But the American prose-epic is the American
prose-epic.

                    <p class="verse8">Reading over your letters I find you wrote me</p>
    <p class="verse">“My dear boy,” or at times “dear boy,” and the envelope</p>
    <p class="verse">Said “master”—all as I had been your very son,</p>
    <p class="verse">And not the orphan whom you adopted.</p>
    <p class="verse">Well, you were father to me! And I can recall</p>
    <p class="verse">The things you did for me or gave me:</p>
    <p class="verse">One time we rode in a box-car to Springfield</p>
    <p class="verse">To see the greatest show on earth;</p>
    <p class="verse">And one time you gave me red-top boots,</p>
    <p class="verse">And one time a watch, and one time a gun.</p>
    <p class="verse">Well, I grew to gawkiness with a voice</p>
    <p class="verse">Like a rooster trying to crow in August</p>
    <p class="verse">Hatched in April, we’ll say.</p>
    <p class="verse">And you went about wrapped up in silence</p>
    <p class="verse">With eyes aflame, and I heard little rumors</p>
    <p class="verse">Of what they were doing to you, and how</p>
    <p class="verse">They wronged you—and we were poor—so poor!</p>
    <p class="verse">And I could not understand why you failed,</p>
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
    <p class="verse">And why if you did good things for the people</p>
    <p class="verse">The people did not sustain you.</p>
    <p class="verse">And why you loved another woman than Aunt Susan,</p>

    <p class="verse">At last you fell ill, and for months you tottered</p>
    <p class="verse">Around the streets as thin as death,</p>
    <p class="verse">Trying to earn our bread, your great eyes glowing</p>
    <p class="verse">And the silence around you like a shawl!</p>
    <p class="verse">But something in you kept you up.</p>
    <p class="verse">You grew well again and rosy with cheeks</p>
    <p class="verse">Like an Indian peach almost, and eyes</p>
    <p class="verse">Full of moonlight and sunlight, and a voice</p>
    <p class="verse">That sang, and a humor that warded</p>
    <p class="verse">The arrows off. But still between us</p>
    <p class="verse">There was reticence; you kept me away</p>
    <p class="verse">With a glittering hardness; perhaps you thought</p>
    <p class="verse">I kept you away—for I was moving</p>
    <p class="verse">In spheres you knew not, living through</p>
    <p class="verse">Beliefs you believed in no more, and ideals</p>
    <p class="verse">That were just mirrors of unrealities.</p>
    <p class="verse">As a boy can be I was critical of you.</p>
    <p class="verse">And reasons for your failures began to arise</p>
    <p class="verse">In my mind—I saw specific facts here and there</p>
    <p class="verse">With no philosophy at hand to weld them</p>
    <p class="verse">And synthesize them into one truth—</p>
    <p class="verse">And a rush of the strength of youth</p>
    <p class="verse">Deluded me into thinking the world</p>
    <p class="verse">Was something so easily understood and managed</p>
    <p class="verse">While I knew it not at all in truth.</p>
    <p class="verse">And an adolescent egotism</p>
    <p class="verse">Made me feel you did not know me</p>

    <p class="verse">You thought of what I might be, and where</p>
    <p class="verse">Life would take me, and how it would end—</p>
    <p class="verse">There was longer silence. A year or two</p>
    <p class="verse">Brought me closer to you. I saw the play now</p>
    <p class="verse">And the game somewhat and understood your fights</p>
    <p class="verse">And enmities, and hardnesses and silences,</p>

<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">e</span> were looking at oriental rugs one day, that enfant terrible, the
Scavenger, and I. There were rugs that tempted me to transgress
the tenth commandment, and there were rugs that jarred me as if I were
listening to Carpenter’s <em>Perambulator</em> stunts. My fellow-flâneur became
impatient with my critical remarks.
</p>

<p>
“You don’t love rugs.” His Svidrigailovian face grinned. “If you
did, you would just love them, you would not quibble. Academician!”
</p>

<p>
The last epithet is used by <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> priests and prophets
as a means to close all arguments. So it did on that occasion. But it left
me pondering over the words of a New York critic who accused our magazine
of being somewhat indiscriminate in its enthusiasm for the sake of
enthusiasm, in its emotionalism for the sake of emotion. I recalled blushingly
the confession of our chief Neo-Hellenist, who is moved aesthetically
by any sort of music, whether it emanates from Kreisler’s Stradivarius or
from the pianola at Henrici’s.
</p>

<p>
I confess I am a fastidious lover. The dearer a person or a thing are
to me the more I demand from them, the more painfully I am hurt by their
flaws. Hence the number of my dislikes exceeds that of my likes. Hence
I grit my teeth at the sight of Maria Gay in <em>Carmen</em>. Because the music of
that opera is so full of eternal symbols to me, because when listening to it
I understand why Nietzsche preferred Bizet to Wagner,—I am scalded
by its vulgar cabaretization. Had I not been stirred by Mr. Powys’ remarkable
liturgy of St. Oscar Wilde, I would not have been so keenly
pricked by his subsequent remark in his Verlaine lecture that Rimbaud was
a ruffian. It is because I cannot live without music that I am compelled
to suffer weekly indigestion from the sauerkraut menus furnished by Mr.
Stock’s bâton. Will Mr. Scavenger of the rug-philosophy expect me not to
swear and damn at the prospect of being doomed to a long season of Meistersingers,
Perambulators, Goldmarckian fudge, Brahmsian Academics, Stockian
Jubilee-Confetti, and similar insults? Let me touch another sore:—the
Little Theatre, the Temple of Living Art, to which I have looked up with
reverence and hope; the only theatrical organization in the city that seemed
to have other considerations outside of box-receipts. I was present at the
opening night of this season, and left the little “catacomb” with an aching
heart. What reason, what artistic reason, is there to stage Andreyev’s
<em>Sabine Women</em> anywhere outside of Russia? The play was written as a
biting satire against the Russian liberals who fought against the government
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
with Tolstoyan Non-Resistance instead of joining the revolutionary proletariat.
In Andreyev’s land he is perfectly, painfully understood; but here,
on Michigan Avenue, the satire degenerated into a boring burlesque! Even
Raymond Johnson’s suggestive, graceful horizons fail to save the situation.
As to <em>Lithuania</em>—what is the matter with the Little Theatre males? They
move and speak like hermaphrodites, they drink vodka and swear in squeaking
falsettoes, they appear so feeble and effeminate in comparison with the
virile, gruesome Ellen Van Volkenburg and Miriam Kipper. Then, how
realistic—shades of Zola! Maurice Browne vomits so much more realistically
than Charlie Chaplin in <em>Shanghaied</em>....
</p>

<p>
Finding myself in the Fine Arts Building, I am in dangerous proximity
of another “Temple” that invites my friendly hostility. But I vision the
brandishment of the Editor’s fatal pencil—silenzia! Yet, if I must refrain
from, or at least postpone, my general attack on <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, let me
be allowed, pray, to whip one of my confreres, the Scavenger. Whether a
sound thrashing will do him good or not is doubtful; but he certainly deserves
flagellation. As a denier, as a depreciator, as an anti, he is as convincing
as a bulldog; but when he loves, when he lauds and affirms, his
voice thins to that of a sick puppy. He should be administered cure from
his mania of showering superlatives upon false gods and counterfeit prophets.
I dislike the rôle of a Good Samaritan, but our Scavenger is so young,
so impressionable; perhaps he will repent. Besides, I sympathize with him.
He is one of those promising Americans who suffocate in their native atmosphere,
or lack of atmosphere, and are easily lured and led astray by
will-o’-the wisps. In his yearning for wings he is apt to proclaim a domestic
rooster as an eagle; in his craving for sun, for light, he often mistakes a
cardboard butaforial sun for Phœbus Apollo. Hence his admiration for
that Arch-Borrower, Huneker. “He is one of the two or three American
critics that are above Puritanic provincialism, that are broad, European!”
exclaims Scavenger. It is true; but this truth serves only as a testimonia
pauperitatis for the intellectual state of this country, where glittering counterfeit
coins are less odious than Simon-pure Americanism. The Huneker-cult
is one of the American tragedies of which I have spoken on other occasions,
the tragedy of surrogates. The young generation, seething with longing for
the great and the beautiful in life and art, is forced to feed on substitutes
in the absence of real quantities. They want to read a living word about
Verlaine, about Huysmans, about Matisse, about those winged titans who
make Trans-Atlantic life so rich and pulsating, and they turn to Huneker,
the great concocter of newspaper clippings and boulevard gossip. When
Scavenger read for me Huneker’s admirable essay on Huysmans I was not
yet aware that whatever was admirable in the essay had been borrowed
almost in toto from Havelock Ellis’s <em>Affirmations</em>.<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> Why use the second
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
or third-hand patched up cloak of Boulevardier-Huneker, when you may
drink from the very source, from Arthur Symons, from Havelock Ellis,
from—oh, well, who can recount them? Ah, the tragedy of substitutes!
</p>

<p>
The other evening, at a gathering of “The Questioners,” I accused
Miss Harriet Monroe and Miss Margaret C. Anderson of being too lenient
editors, in not trying to mould the taste of their contributors. What conscientious
editor would allow a writer of Scavenger’s caliber to descend to
the irritating rhetoric of “The Dionysian Dreiser”? To print this loud
exaggeration immediately after Ben Hecht’s <em>Songs and Sketches</em> is to profess
the rug-philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The Scavenger, as most of his colleagues, is a reformed Puritan. He
finds boyish delight in reading an author who is a professional fence-wrecker
and convention-smasher. To him immoralizing is a virtue <em>per se</em>.
He hails Dreiser as the greatest, for things that he has not done. Dreiser
is a genius because he has not followed the conventional novelist who makes
his villain repent or perish. I admit this; but such a negative virtue, significant
as it may appear in given conditions, does not qualify an artist.
<em>The “Genius”</em> is not art. It is instructive, it is of great value for the study
of contemporary America, as Mr. Masters pointed out. I can imagine that
in the twenty-first century <em>The “Genius”</em> will be used as a textbook for the
history of the United States in the end of the nineteenth century, for the
author has minutely depicted our customs and morals, has gone into detailed
description of country and city life, of farmers’ menues, of stomach-aches
and their cure, of Christian Science wonders, of salaries and prices, of all
the infinitesimal particles that compose the mosaique of mediocre life. Instructive—yes;
but art—by no means. Let me quote Havelock Ellis’s
<em>Affirmations</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
Three strokes with the brush of Frans Hals are worth a thousand
of Denner’s. Rich and minute detail may impress us, but it irritates
and wearies in the end.... When we are living deeply, the facts of
our external life do not present themselves to us in elaborate detail; a
very few points are—as it has been termed—focal in consciousness,
while the rest are marginal in subconsciousness. A few things stand
out vividly at each moment of life; the rest are dim. The supreme
artist is shown by the insight and boldness with which he seizes and
illuminates these bright points at each stage, leaving the marginal elements
in due subordination.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Truisms, aren’t these? I wish Dreiser, “the greatest,” and his hailers
would ponder over them before they apply the term art to 736 pages devoted
to rumination of what Ellis calls “marginal elements” of life. And what
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
a life! In what respect does the life of Witla, the “genius,” deserve so much
elaboration and painstaking analysis? The hero’s only distinction is his
sexual looseness. But he is not a Sanin who gratifies his animalistic instincts
with contempt for motivation or justification. Witla, and Dreiser,
and Scavenger, are reformed Puritans. When Witla falls in “love” with the
round arm of a laundress, or with the golden hair of a country girl, or with
the black eyes of an art-model, or with the perfect form of a gambler’s
wife, or with the innocence of a mama’s girl; when in each case the lover
swears and damns and lyricizes in bad English and strives to win and possess
the object d’art, Mr. Dreiser appears from behind the sinner, pats him
on the shoulder, and flings defiantly into the faces of the terrified philistines:
“Witla is all-right. He is an artist. He loves beautiful things. See,
God damn you?!” Is he? Throughout the long book we are told time and
again that he is an <em>artist</em>. Unless we take the author’s word for it we are
inclined to doubt it very much. True, an artist loves beauty; but does he
necessarily desire to possess the object of his admiration? Does not the
contemplation of a beautiful arm or sunset or flower or vase or rug bring
the artist complete satisfaction and possession? I do not condemn Witla;
although I dislike him, for he is a loud mediocrity. There is a Witla in
every one of us men; but we take our Witla as our animalistic self, not as
the artistic.

Ah, dear Scavenger, I do love rugs. But there are rugs and rugs.

<p class="footnote2">
The first edition of the book was issued about twenty years ago, yet
one reads it now with keen joy. With the exception of the essay on Nietzsche,
which is somewhat obsolete, the essays on Zola, Huysmans, Casanova,
and St. Francis have stood the test of time. One feels the breeze of cleanness,
freshness, sincerity, and profundity. I may have an opportunity of
discussing the book some other time.

The Scavenger’s Swan Song
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> a remarkable fellow my friend the Incurable is! I talk to him
about rugs, quite casually, as we wait for a car, and what does this devil of
a psychologist do but walk deep into my soul on one of them. I read him
a Huneker article on Huysmans which he remarks is excellent at the time,
only to find (almost too late) that I should have read Havelock Ellis....
</p>

<p>
How I envy him this distinction of having read Havelock Ellis instead
of James Huneker, of being subtle enough to prefer the deep, metaphysical
didactics concerning Life (with a capital L, Miss Editor) to the contemplation
of that most seductive of literary signposts—Huneker. But it is so
foolish to quibble about books.... If I had anything else to do I
wouldn’t read them....
</p>

<p>
Puritan, indeed! That is too much. I suspect it is only a withering
retort, a ferocious counter to the “academic charges.” But what of Dreiser—poor,
little, smug, banal, and illiterate Dreiser? You should have spared
him. You remember on the elevated going home one night how I pleaded
with you to spare him, how I argued, defended, fought? Ah, I am shamed.
I feel somehow responsible for this annihilation of a man, aye a good
writer, who was fast becoming one of the great men of America....
</p>

<p>
When you speak of music everything becomes clear to me. Here am I
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
who like music well enough to have studied it for ten years, who can
improvise as well on the violin as on the typewriter, but who nevertheless
have been denied the capacity for experiencing the critical disorganization
of the soul at the sound of bad music, and nervous exaltations at the sound
of good. I suffer and gloat—but subjectively. To me music is a background....
It is not my natural form of self-expression. Neither
are rugs.
</p>

<p>
And I haven’t time to be a connoisseur. Later—perhaps. But now
I reduce all such differences of attitude as yours and mine to the everlasting
wrangle between the connoisseur and the improviser. Yes?
</p>

<p>
Puritan! That is nothing. Later you will call me charlatan because
I sometimes compose paradoxes and even epigrams. Culture abhors an
epigram.
</p>

<p>
Ho! ho! the devil take you and all critics. We ride the crests—Miss
Editor and I. Once my friend the Incurable rode the crests and they
washed him up on a foreign shore, and now he calls the crests “foam” or
“emotion for emotion’s sake” or a lot of other rather true things. To ride
on the crests as long as you can—that’s the life (a small “l,” Miss Editor);
to think one thing today and another tomorrow, to have lots of fun, to
yell while you’re young, to believe Havelock Ellis a bearded old lady—in
short, “klushnik,” to follow the care-free, tortuous path of improvisation,
self-expression, instead of pursuing the lugubrious catacombs of criticism
and connoisseurship.
</p>

<p>
As for my article, “The Dionysian Dreiser,” I will not defend that.
Your abuse of that writing coupled with your smug praise of Ben Hecht’s
atrocious poetry (concerning which I agree with my friend “Bubble”
Bodenheim, who told me it was so bad on the whole that he couldn’t get
it out of his mind) is inconsistent.
</p>

<p>
Ah, friend, may my death and Dreiser’s be forever on your conscience.

Life
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> sun was shining in the dirty street.
</p>

<p>
Old women with shapeless bodies waddled along on their way
to market.
</p>

<p>
Bearded old men who looked like the fathers of Jerusalem walked
flatfooted, nodding back and forth.
</p>

<p>
“The tread of the processional surviving in Halsted street,” thought
Moisse, the young dramatist who was moving with the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Children sprawled in the refuse-laden alleys. One of them ragged
and clotted with dirt stood half-dressed on the curbing and urinated into
the street.
</p>

<p>
Wagons rumbled, filled with fruits and iron and rags and vegetables.
</p>

<p>
Human voices babbled above the noises of the traffic. Moisse watched
the lively scene.
</p>

<p>
“Every day it’s the same,” he thought; “the same smells, the same
noise and people swarming over the pavements. I am the only one in the
street whose soul is awake. There’s a pretty girl looking at me. She suspects
the condition of my soul. Her fingers are dirty. Why doesn’t she
buy different shoes? She thinks I am lost. In five years she will be fat.
In ten years she will waddle with a shawl over her head.”
</p>

<p>
The young dramatist smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Good God,” he thought, “where do they come from. Where are they
going? No place to no place. But always moving, shuffling, waddling,
crying out. The sun shines on them. The rain pours on them. It burns.
It freezes. Today they are bright with color. Tomorrow they are grey
with gloom. But they are always the same, always in motion.”
</p>

<p>
The young dramatist stopped on the corner and looking around him
spied a figure sitting on the sidewalk, leaning against the wall of a building.
</p>

<p>
The figure was an old man.
</p>

<p>
He had a long white beard.
</p>

<p>
He had his legs tucked under him and an upturned tattered hat rested
in his lap.
</p>

<p>
His thin face was raised and the sun beat down on it, but his eyes
were closed.
</p>

<p>
“Asleep,” mused Moisse.
</p>

<p>
He moved closer to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
The man’s head was covered with long silky white hair that hung down
to his neck and hid his ears. It was uncombed. His face in the sun looked
like the face of an ascetic, thin, finely veined.
</p>

<p>
He had a long nose and almost colorless lips and the skin on his cheeks
was white. It was drawn tight over his bones, leaving few wrinkles.
</p>

<p>
An expression of peace rested over him—peace and detachment. Of
the noise and babble he heard nothing. His eyes were closed to the crowded
frantic street.
</p>

<p>
He sat, his head back, his face bathed in the sun, smileless and
dreaming.
</p>

<p>
“A beggar,” thought Moisse, “asleep, oblivious. Dead. All day he
sits in the sun like a saint, immobile. Like one of the old Alexandrian
ascetics, like a delicately carved image. He is awake in himself but dead
to others. The waves cannot touch him. His thoughts, oh to know his
thoughts and his dreams?”
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the eyes of the young dramatist widened. He was looking
at the beggar’s long hair that hung to his neck.
</p>

<p>
“It’s moving,” he whispered half aloud. He came closer and stood
over the old man and gazed intently at the top of his head.
</p>

<p>
The hair was swaying faintly, each separate fiber moving alone....
</p>

<p>
It shifted, rose imperceptibly and fell. It quivered and glided....
</p>

<p>
“Lice,” murmured Moisse.
</p>

<p>
He watched.
</p>

<p>
Silent and asleep the old man sat with his thin face to the sun and
his hair moved.
</p>

<p>
Vermin swarmed through it creeping, crawling, tiny and infinitesimal.
</p>

<p>
Every strand was palpitating, shuddering under their mysterious energy.
</p>

<p>
At first Moisse could hardly make them out but his eyes gradually
grew accustomed to the sight. And as he watched he saw the hair swell
like waves riding over the water, saw it drop and flutter, coil and uncoil
of its own accord.
</p>

<p>
Vermin raised it up, pulled it out, streaming up and down tirelessly
in vast armies.
</p>

<p>
They crawled furiously like dust specks blown thick through the white
beard.
</p>

<p>
They streamed and shifted and were never still.
</p>

<p>
They moved in and out, from no place to no place, but always moving,
frantic, and frenzied.
</p>

<p>
An old woman passed and with a shake of her head dropped two
pennies into the upturned hat. Moisse hardly saw her. He saw only the
palpitating swarms that were now racing, easily visible, through the grey
white hair.
</p>

<p>
Some ventured down over the white ascetic face, crawling in every
direction, traveling around the lips and over the closed eyes, emerging
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
suddenly in thick streams from behind the covered ears and losing themselves
under the ever moving beard.
</p>

<p>
And Moisse, his senses strained, thought he heard a noise—a faint
crunching noise.
</p>

<p>
He listened.
</p>

<p>
The noise seemed to grow louder. He began to itch but he remained
bending over the head. He could hear them, like a faraway murmur, a
purring, uncertain sound.
</p>

<p>
“They’re shouting and groaning, crying out, weeping and laughing,”
he mused. “It is life ... life....”
</p>

<p>
He looked up and down the crowded burning street with its frantic
crowd, and smiled.
</p>

<p>
“Life,” he repeated....
</p>

<p>
He walked away. Before him floated the hair of the beggar moving as
if stirred by a slow wind, and he itched.
</p>

<p>
“But who was the old man?” he thought.
</p>

<p>
A young woman, plump and smiling, jostled him. He felt her soft
hip pressing against him for a moment.
</p>

<p>
A child running barefoot through the street brushed against his legs.
He felt its sticky fingers seize him for an instant and then the child was
gone. On he walked.
</p>

<p>
Three young men confronted him for a second time. He passed between
two of them, squeezed by their shoulders.
</p>

<p>
A shapeless old woman bumped him with her back as she shuffled past.
</p>

<p>
Two children dodged in and out screaming and seized his arm to
turn on.
</p>

<p>
The young dramatist stopped and remained standing still, looking
about him.
</p>

<p>
Then he laughed.
</p>

<p>
“Life,” he murmured again; and
</p>

<p>
“I am the old man,” he added, “I ... I....”
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="DEPTHS">
Depths
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Crowds began to come out of the buildings.
</p>

<p>
They came in streams and broad waves, breaking in a black sweep over
the pavements and spreading into a thick long mass that moved forward.
The glassy lights cut the twilight drizzel with their yellow fire. The tumult
grew until up and down the street an unceasing din sounded, shrieking,
roaring, clanging noises.
</p>

<p>
Moisse, the young dramatist, stood against one of the office buildings
as the throngs spilled past him on their ways home. His eyes were fixed
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
on the distant gloom of the sky which hung beyond the drizzel and the fuzzy
glare of light like a vast black froth.
</p>

<p>
“It is so silent,” mused Moisse. “Millions of miles without a sound.
Man and his accomplishments are infinitesimal,” went on the young dramatist
as the swelling throng brushed and buffeted against him, “but his ego is
infinite. Only by thought can he reach the stars.”
</p>

<p>
He was thoughtless for a moment, holding his position with difficulty
as the crowds pressed past. Then he resumed:
</p>

<p>
“None of them looks at me. None of them imagines I am thinking
of the stars. How startled these fat evil-smelling men and women would
be if they could see my thought for a moment as they crashed along their
tiny ways. But nevertheless I don’t eat tonight,” he murmured suddenly,
as if awakening. And the idea plunged him into a series of reflections from
which he emerged with a frown and looked about him.
</p>

<p>
A short thick man with an unshaven face was shuffling past. His skin
was broken under his growth of beard with red and purple sores. His
mouth hung open, his eyes stared ahead of him and his head was bent forward.
Moisse thought of the body concealed by the layers of caked rags
which covered the man, and shuddered.
</p>

<p>
“He never bathes,” mused the young dramatist. “I wonder what a
creature like that does.” And he followed him slowly.
</p>

<p>
At the corner the man stopped and blew his nose violently with his
fingers. Another block and he stopped again, bending over in the midst
of the crowd and straightening with a cigar butt in his hand. He eyed
the thing critically. It was flattened at the end where feet had passed over
it. The man thrust it between his lips and shuffled on.
</p>

<p>
In a vestibule he extracted a blackened match from his pocket and
with shaking fingers lighted the butt. When it burned he blew a cloud
of smoke, and taking it out of his mouth regarded it with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Several in the throng noticed him, their eyes resting with disapproval
and sometimes hate upon the figure. Once a crossing policeman spied
him and followed him with his gaze until he was lost to view.
</p>

<p>
Moisse kept abreast of him and together they turned into an alley
that led behind a hotel. The man’s eyes never wavered, but remained
fixed in the direction he was moving.
</p>

<p>
The alley was dark. In the court that ran behind the hotel were several
large, battered cans that shone dully against the black wall. Debris littered
the ground. Looking furtively at the closed doors the man made his way
to one of the cans.
</p>

<p>
He lifted the cover cautiously and thrust his arm into its depths. For
several minutes he remained with his arm lost inside the refuse can.
</p>

<p>
“He’s found something,” whispered Moisse.
</p>

<p>
The man straightened. In his hand he held an object on which sparks
seemed to race up and down like blue insects.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
He raised his find to his face and then thrust it into his pocket and
resumed his shuffle down the alley.
</p>

<p>
“To think,” mused Moisse, “of a man eating out of a garbage can.
Either he is inordinately hungry or careless to a point of ... of....”
</p>

<p>
He searched for a word that refused to appear and he followed slowly
after the man. In the dim light of a side street the man paused and took
out his booty. It was evidently the back of a fowl.
</p>

<p>
Standing still the man thrust it into his mouth, gnawing and tearing at
its bones. After he had eaten for several minutes he held it up to the light
and started picking at shreds of meat with his fingers. These he licked off
his hand.
</p>

<p>
The meal was at length finished. The man threw the gleaned bones
away, blew his nose and walked on.
</p>

<p>
Through the dark tumbled streets Moisse followed. The shuffling
figure fascinated him. He noted the gradually increasing degradation of
the neighborhood, the hovels that seemed like torn, blackened rags, the
broken streets piled with refuse and mud.
</p>

<p>
In front of a lighted house the man stopped. The curtains which
hung over the two front windows of the house were torn. One of them
was half destroyed and Moisse saw into the room in which a gas jet
flickered and which was empty.
</p>

<p>
The man walked up the steps and knocked at the door. It was opened.
</p>

<p>
“A woman,” whispered Moisse.
</p>

<p>
She vanished, and the man followed her. The two appeared in a
moment in the room with the gas light.
</p>

<p>
The woman was tall and thin, her hair hung down her back in two
scimpy braids. Her face was coated with paint and great hollows loomed
under her eyes.
</p>

<p>
The man walked to her, his open mouth widened in a grin.
</p>

<p>
“They’re talking,” murmured the young dramatist as he watched their
haggard faces move strangely. He noted the woman was dressed in a
wrapper, colorless and streaked.
</p>

<p>
“I wonder—” he began, but the scene captured his attention. He
watched absorbed. The woman was shaking her head and backing away
from the man who finally halted in the center of the room.
</p>

<p>
He lifted a foot from the floor and removed its shoe. Standing with
the shoe in his hand his eyes glistened at the woman who watched him with
her neck stretched forward and a sneer on her lips.
</p>

<p>
The man put his hand in the shoe and brought out a coin.
</p>

<p>
“A twenty-five cent piece,” muttered Moisse.
</p>

<p>
The man held it up in his fingers and laughed. His face distorted itself
into strange wrinkles when he laughed. Moisse who could not hear
the laugh saw only an imbecilic grimace. The woman took the coin, and
left the room.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
She returned in a moment holding out her arms to the man.
</p>

<p>
He seized her, crushing her body against him until she was bent
backward. He pressed his face over her, his mouth still open, his eyes
staring.
</p>

<p>
The woman stared back and laughed, fastening her lips suddenly
to his.
</p>

<p>
Losing his balance, the man staggered and the woman broke from his
grasp. He pounced on her, seizing her hand and jerking her against him.
</p>

<p>
As she held back he raised his fist and struck her fiercely in the face.
She swayed for an instant and then stood quiet.
</p>

<p>
Her lips began to smile and move in speech. The man shook his head
rapturously, rubbing his nose with a finger and panting.
</p>

<p>
Moisse turned away and walked slowly toward the town.
</p>

<p>
“Good God,” he murmured, “he’ll take his clothes off and she....”
</p>

<p>
His emotions began to trouble him. An unrest stirred his body.
</p>

<p>
“I should have gone in there and taken her away from him,” he mused,
and then with a shudder he walked on—smiling.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="GRATITUDE">
Gratitude
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The avenue bubbled brightly under the grey rain.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon crowd had melted from the sidewalk, washed into hallways
and under awnings by the downpour.
</p>

<p>
It began to look like evening. A refreshing gloom settled over the
street.
</p>

<p>
The wind leaped out of alley courts and byways and raced over the
pavement accompanied by spattering arpeggios of rain.
</p>

<p>
Moisse, the young dramatist, turned into the avenue. His voluminous
black raincoat, reaching from his ears to his shoe tops, flapped in front
of him.
</p>

<p>
By exercising the most diligent effort, however, he managed rather to
saunter than walk, and he kept his eyes raptly fixed upon the deserted
stretch of shining cement.
</p>

<p>
As he moved peacefully along he repeated to himself:
</p>

<p>
“The rain leaps and <a id="corr-6"></a>pirouettes like a chorus of Russian elves. It jumps.
It bounces. It hops, skips, and runs. Flocks of little excited silver birds
are continually alighting around my feet and chattering in a thousand
voices. I should have been a poet.”
</p>

<p>
Removing his gaze from the ground he looked at the faces which
lined the buildings and floated like pale lamps in the darkened vestibules.
</p>

<p>
“Everyone is watching me,” he thought, “for in my attitude there is
the careless courage of an unconscious heroism. I stroll along indifferent
to the rain. It splashes down my neck. It takes the crease out of my
trousers. It trickles off the brim of my hat.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
“And all this stamps me momentarily in these afflicted minds as an
unusual human.
</p>

<p>
“That one with the monogomistic side-whiskers is wondering what a
queer fellow I am.
</p>

<p>
“What can it be that engrosses my attention to the point of making
me so oblivious to the rain?
</p>

<p>
“And that fat woman with the face like a toy balloon is certain I will
catch my death of cold.
</p>

<p>
“The little girl with the wide eyes thinks I am in love.
</p>

<p>
“There is an infinite source of speculation in my simple conduct.”
</p>

<p>
The water was making headway down the back of his neck, but Moisse
hesitated and then abstained from adjusting his collar more firmly.
</p>

<p>
“They will notice it,” he thought, “and immediately I will lose the distinctive
aloofness which characterizes me now.”
</p>

<p>
So moving leisurely down the avenue Moisse, the young dramatist,
progressed, his eyes apparently unconscious of the scene before him, his
soul oblivious to the saturated world, and his mind occupied with distant
and mysterious thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The downpour began to assume the proportions of a torrent. Moisse
persisted in his tracks.
</p>

<p>
Someone touched his elbow.
</p>

<p>
He turned and found a little old man with faded eyes and threadbare,
dripping clothes smiling earnestly at his side.
</p>

<p>
The little old man was bent in the shoulders. His shirt had no collar.
His brown coat was buttoned to his neck.
</p>

<p>
His face screwed up by a sensitiveness to the cataract of drops beating
against it, was round and full of wrinkles.
</p>

<p>
It had the quizzical, goodnatured look of a fuzzy little dog.
</p>

<p>
His wet eyes that seemed to be swimming in a red moisture peered at
Moisse who was frowning.
</p>

<p>
“I’m hungry,” began the little old man, “I ain’t had anything to eat—”
</p>

<p>
“How much do you want?” inquired Moisse.
</p>

<p>
“Anything,” said the beggar.
</p>

<p>
The young dramatist felt in his pocket. A single half-dollar encountered
his fingers.
</p>

<p>
“I’ve only got a half-dollar,” he said, “I’ll get it changed. Come on.”
</p>

<p>
The two of them walked in silence, Moisse still sauntering, the little
old man bent over and looking as if he wanted to speak but was afraid of
dissipating a dream.
</p>

<p>
“Wait here,” Moisse said suddenly, “I’ll go in and get change.”
</p>

<p>
He stepped into the box office of one of the large moving-picture
theaters on the avenue and secured change.
</p>

<p>
The little old man had followed him inside the building, his eyes
watching him with an eager curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
Moisse turned with the change to find the beggar at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
He handed him fifteen cents.
</p>

<p>
“What’s the matter?” he inquired. “Been drinking?”
</p>

<p>
“No, no,” said the beggar.
</p>

<p>
“Why haven’t you?” persisted Moisse frowning; “don’t you know
there’s nothing for you but drink. That’s what drink is for. Men like you.”
</p>

<p>
The faded eyes livened.
</p>

<p>
“Now you go and get yourself three good shots of booze,” went on
Moisse, “and you’ll be a new man for the rest of the day.”
</p>

<p>
The beggar had become excited.
</p>

<p>
His lips moved in a nervous delight but he uttered no sound. With
the fingers of his right hand he picked at the blackened and <a id="corr-7"></a>roughly-bitten
nails of his other. He cleared his throat and then as if suddenly inspired,
removed his drenched hat and raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
Touched by the sincerity of the little old man’s emotions the young
dramatist reached into his pocket and brought forth another ten cent piece.
</p>

<p>
“Here,” he said, “buy two more drinks.”
</p>

<p>
The little man seemed about to break into a dance. His face became
tinged with the pink of an old woman’s cheek.
</p>

<p>
The red moisture ran out of his eyes in two white tears. Moisse regarded
him, frowning.
</p>

<p>
“Once you were young as I am today,” said Moisse aloud, fastening
his eyes upon the top of the little old man’s head which seemed dirty and
bald despite the pale hair, and alive.
</p>

<p>
“Perhaps you had ambitions and then some commonplace occurred
and you lost them. And now you float around begging nickles. That’s
interesting. A little old man begging nickles in the rain.”
</p>

<p>
The beggar smiled eagerly and then ventured a slight laugh.
</p>

<p>
He came closer to Moisse and stood trembling.
</p>

<p>
“Asking for crumbs,” went on Moisse with a deepening frown, “cursed
at night when alone by memories that will not die. Eh?” He looked suddenly
into the faded eyes and smiled.
</p>

<p>
The little old man nodded his head vigorously. He caught his breath
and stood looking at Moisse with his mouth open and his <a id="corr-8"></a>cheeks wrinkled
as if he were about to cry.
</p>

<p>
His breath struck the young dramatist and he averted his nose.
</p>

<p>
“Strange,” resumed he, “now you have a quarter and I have a quarter
and still we remain so different. Isn’t it strange, old fellow? Yet it is
the inevitable inequality of men that makes us brothers.”
</p>

<p>
The beggar was about to speak. Moisse paused and looked with interest
at the round face, the quivering nostrils and the lips that were twitching
into speech.
</p>

<p>
“No one has talked to me like you,” he said, “no one.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
And he caught his breath and stared with a strange expression at his
benefactor.
</p>

<p>
He bit at a finger nail and lowered his head. He seemed suddenly in
the throes of a great mental struggle for his face had become earnest.
</p>

<p>
It endured for a moment and then he looked at Moisse.
</p>

<p>
“You—you want me to come along with you,” he said and he scratched
at the back of his ear.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll come along if you want me to,” he repeated.
</p>

<p>
“Come along? Where?” Moisse asked, his eyes awakening.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, anyplace,” said the little old man. “I ain’t particular, if you
ain’t.”
</p>

<p>
He was breathing quickly and he reached for the palm of his patron.
</p>

<p>
A deep light had come into his face. His faded eyes had grown
stronger. Their quizzical look was gone and they were burning in their
wet depths.
</p>

<p>
They looked now with a maternal intensity into the eyes of Moisse and
their smile staggered the sophistication of the young dramatist.
</p>

<p>
The little old man continued to breathe hard until he began to quiver.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly assumed command.
</p>

<p>
“Come,” he said, seizing Moisse by the palm and squeezing it. “I know
a place we can go and get a room cheap and where we won’t be disturbed.
It ain’t so nice a place but come.”
</p>

<p>
He squeezed the palm he held for the second time.
</p>

<p>
The deep light that had come into his little dog’s face softened and two
tears rolled again out of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He caught his breath in a sob.
</p>

<p>
“I—I don’t drink,” he said; “I’m hungry—but I can wait ... until
we get through.”
</p>

<p>
He was beaming coquettishly through his tears and fondling the young
dramatist’s hand.
</p>

<p>
“I can wait,” he repeated, raising his blue lips toward Moisse, his face
transfigured and glowing pink.
</p>

<p>
“I see,” said Moisse, withdrawing his hand with an involuntary shudder.
He was about to say something but he turned, again involuntarily,
and hurried away, breaking into a run when he found himself in the rain.
</p>

<p>
The little old man’s face drooped.
</p>

<p>
He walked slowly staring after him.
</p>

<p>
He stood bareheaded while the rain bombarded his drenched figure
and he looked at the young dramatist running.
</p>

<p>
While he stood gazing after him his face screwed up was suffused with
a strange tenderness and the tears dripped out of his eyes.

<em>Emma Goldman at the Fine Arts Theatre</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">B</span><span class="postfirstchar">eginning</span> Sunday night, November 21, Emma Goldman is
to deliver nine new lectures in the most interesting playhouse
in town—the Fine Arts Theatre, Chicago home of the Irish Players
and Miss Horniman’s company and Miss Barnsdall’s Players’ Producing
company, etc. The complete list of lectures will be found
on page 44.
</p>

<p>
The first, on “Preparedness”—well, if you heard the Powys-Browne
debate last Sunday night and agree with Margery Currey
that Mr. Browne struck the roots of the issue, then I <em>beg</em> you to
hear Emma Goldman. Mr. Browne said something about the real
issue being whether people would rather kill or be killed. I could
scarcely believe my ears.... If you once listen to Emma
Goldman talking of fundamentals you can never fall for sentimentalizations
again.

<em>Will Our Readers Help?</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is a beautiful plan on foot to help <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
live through its third year. It is this:
</p>

<p>
If our readers will order their books through the Gotham Book
Society we will receive a certain percentage on all the sales. This
arrangement has been made with the publishers, so that any book
you want, whether listed in our pages or not, may be procured at
the same price for which it is on sale at your local bookseller’s—and
sometimes even less than that. You will find full particulars
on page 50 of this issue.
</p>

<p>
Radical magazines do not become popular, and the problem of
meeting the cost of production every month is really a desperate
one. If there is a good response to this plan we ought to make the
bulk of our publishing cost out of it, and then we can devote our
energies to the improvement of the magazine’s quality. Will you
please keep this in mind when ordering your books? It will mean
such a tremendous thing to us!

John Cowper Powys on War
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Margery Currey</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> was a quite, quite dreadful jolt that shook the John Cowper Powys
cult on the night of the debate between the master and Maurice Browne
of the Little Theatre. The great one, appearing robed in black, through his
Delphic, released, blinding vapor clouds of infallible utterance, was to devastate
the suggestion that war is evil, avoidable, and should not be prepared
for by military methods. Maurice Browne was to defend the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
Scarce half a moon before had the first murmuring of discontent arisen
among the worshipers of the temple, when their idol, beautiful, mordant,
flaming, strode forth in flapping black garments and proclaimed that in
this great war of many nations “the gall and vitriol and wormwood and
uncleanness of mankind are burned, purged from the purified flesh of humanity;
that then humanity is transformed, until the passion of hate is
hardly distinguishable from the passion of love.”
</p>

<p>
The master himself was the glorious vulture of war. Looming there
on the stage of the Little Theatre, black, huge, alone under a vast orange
sky heavily streaked with black, a violet light from somewhere touching
the crimson of his face—and beside him in that great lonely cosmos an iridescent
emerald bowl upon a high ivory pedestal. That little, little iridescent
bowl, the ivory, the vast peace of a universe, no coagulating clots
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
hanging from the shreds of bodies torn and entangled in the barbed wire
meshes of the trenches, no cries—only one huge black moving thing there.
</p>

<p>
“War a great evil and an unmitigated wrong? I cannot see it. A
pacifist struggle for existence is only a meaner struggle. They are fools
who think it advisable or possible to stamp out war; they are knaves if,
thinking this possible or advisable, they still go on a pacifist crusade.”
</p>

<p>
Followed then the picture of a well-managed nation during war, a
regime of exalted socialism—the pooling of all moneys, the raising of the
income tax, the rich paying for the needs of the poor; she who was once
thought a bedraggled hussy of London’s east end now become a savior of
her country, in her potential gift of a son to the recruiting office of her
country; the high price now set on flesh and blood, even that of the most
humble.
</p>

<p>
Well, all this heroic joy and thin-ice socialism—it was announced at the
end of the evening that the week after the subject would be Walt Whitman.
Thank heaven! Let his people listen to John Cowper Powys on Walt Whitman.
Of these he should speak—of Walt Whitman, of Oscar Wilde, of
Huysmans and Richepin and Milton and Ficke and Baudelaire and Goethe
and Shakespeare. On these he speaks divinely. Peace and war indeed!
</p>

<p>
And the debate? There stood Maurice Browne in valiant opposition,
really “the idealist and fanatic” as his opponent called him, not adding “the
clear thinker,” the rejector of temptations to revel in obvious and facile
romanticisms on the sweet decorum of dying for one’s country, with all the
talk of defending one’s beloved from the hand of the ravager. There were
even those who understood Mr. Browne when his bravery and his prophetic
sight let him dare to say such things as “It is better to be killed than to
kill. To refrain from a combat of violence when the victims might be your
dearest ones is not to put a finger in the cogs of God’s orderly universe. It
is a question of looking the God that is within you in the face.” As for the
merits of the debate, the matter of war and its avoidableness was not
touched on in its practical aspects, except by one who presided over the
meeting and in three intelligent moments discussed the economic and the
proved sides of war. <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is no tract, and we may pass
that by as understood.
</p>

<p>
And after it all, out of an audience of two hundred and twenty—when
they overflowed the Little Theatre they trooped to the Fine Arts Assembly
Room—eighty-four stood up to announce their conviction that war is not
evil, not avoidable, and should be prepared for by military methods, and
some sixty others stood up to indicate their opposite conviction! The vote
was on the merits of the question.

<p class="subt">
THE WASHINGTON SQUARE PLAYERS
</p>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Saxe Commins</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">ere</span> I a self-appointed apologist for the Washington Square Players
I might be able to say with gracious fairness that “their works are
not worth as much as their endeavors but their endeavors are heroic.” But
I am not inclined to pardon these enthusiasts whose enthusiasm has become
cautious, whose ideals are inoffensive, whose outlines are blurred by an
undiscerning dilettantism, who in the absence of a dominant individual
characteristic flounder helplessly through an unbalanced, inartistic program,
that is only relieved, fortunately, by Mr. Phil Moeller’s delicious satire
<em>Helena’s Husband</em>.
</p>

<p>
“It is not from what you emancipate yourself, it is for what.”—Let us
see whether the Washington Square Players have really liberated themselves
from the Broadway tradition of “getting it over,” from the sacrifice
of the artistic for the opportune, and from the fear of offending the generous
critics of the New York Press and incidentally a gullible public. “What
have they done that has an element of daring, invigorating thought,” was
asked of one of the members of the producing staff. “<em>My Lady’s Honor</em>,
one of last year’s plays,” was his answer. To those who were unfortunate
enough to have seen this pseudo-feminist tract—George Broadhurst supplanting
Ibsen in a free theatre—I need not tell what resentment that remark
aroused. Nor could those who saw <em>Moondown</em> on the same bill be
more antagonized than I was when I heard so fatuous a statement as “If
we had more plays like <em>Moondown</em> we would establish the equivalent in
America to the Celtic renaissance.” Is this “for what” the Washington
Square Players have emancipated themselves? Even if <em>Moondown</em> had any
value in itself would they deserve any credit for an aspiration that is only
a conditional imitation? I take these casual expressions of members of the
organization critically because there is a most noticeable absence of persistent,
highly individualized effort, because there is a majority rule, the
odorlessness of an insipid mixture prevalent in the atmosphere about the
Band Box. They are successful—unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
Consider the present bill. Has the play-reading committee shown any
distinction that differentiates it from those Broadway theatrical agencies that
supply syndicated thrills on demand? Have they not arranged their programme
without any regard for balance, to the vaudeville formula in this
manner: One curtain-raiser on a current topic—of course the war; one
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
play cut and measured for the star, a misfit, to prepare you for the middle
piece, in this instance an amazingly clever satire by Phil Moeller; and then
the end-up—(Yes, they have outgrown Broadway; they don’t wave a big
American flag as a grand finale number)—in this spirit: “wouldn’t a fancifully
pagan thing be very nice to show that we have a conception of the
beautiful?” Voilà—the whole is the sum of its parts, mathematically accurate,
yes; but “who knows whether two and two don’t make five” in the
science of Esthetics, if there is such a thing.
</p>

<p>
Where, I cannot understand, is their proclaimed aspiration of finding
plays which fulfill the artistic merit that they would lead us to believe the
New York theatre-goer demands? If there is such a public, do they think
and choose for them secure in the belief that the patient supporters of these
sterile Little Theatre movements will abide such exploitation? Is their
complacency so complete that they can disregard every requirement that a
“New Theatre” movement imposes and yet get away with it? When I
use the term “New Theatre” I mean it in the Strindbergian sense, a new
and thoroughly iconoclastic theatre that panders to no opinion, whose merit
lies solely in an individual and artistic distinction, a theatre that has something
of the “continual slight novelty.”
</p>

<p>
<em>Fire and Water</em>, the opening play of the bill by Hervey White, is a
sacrifice of art to the god of timeliness, an inane argument, an undramatic
episode, a virtuous plea against War that permits its author to air some
abstractions on brotherhood and equality with utter disregard for the tenseness
or the dramatic possibilities of the situation. Broadway knows better.
They, at least, are both opportune and spectacular and do not pour forth
so much of what Nietzsche calls “moralic acid.”
</p>

<p>
<em>Night of Snow</em>, by Roberto Bracco, seems chosen ostensibly to allow
Mr. Ralph Roeder to cover as great an area of the stage as is possible in
forty-five minutes of monotonous gesture to the melodious obligato of a
voice ranting second-rate Hamlet self-lacerations. It tells the story of a
person half gentleman, half derelict, who likes to cry about it while his
mistress and mother indulge themselves to satiation with sickly sweet sacrifice.
“I am his Mo-ho-ther” etcetera. What a relief was Moeller’s play—a
play that could not even be contaminated by its environment. I think
Anatole France would be glad to have written it. <em>Helena’s Husband</em> is
much more than an historical interpretation of a phase of the Trojan wars.
It is the truth! Moeller is more than clever. He knows as well as France
that “history is a pack of lies.”

<em>The Antick</em>, by Percy Mackaye, is a devitalized Pagan attempt which
in spite of charming Lupokova was extremely tedious. I heard little of it,
so poor was the enunciation of the actors, and for my concentrated attention
I was rewarded with an incoherent effort to transplant Pan to barren,
colorless New England. I wonder whether Mr. Mackaye ever read Pater’s
<em>Denys L’Auxerrois</em>?

At least the Washington Square Players presume to desire, even though
it be in a misdirected manner. Will they overcome the affable praise that
they get so generously from uncritical critics? Will they mature sufficiently
to recognize the mistakes of their infancy? There is still hope that they can
be saved from success. Where is the strong, perhaps tyrannical, individual
who can do it?

Whoever hasn’t seen the Little Theatre’s production of Rupert Brooke’s
<em>Lithuania</em> has missed an excellent although unimportant dramatic treat. It
is the most “effective” thing of its kind I ever have seen executed in Chicago.
It is one prolonged and unrelieved shudder from start to finish.
</p>

<p>
Rupert Brooke is the hero of the occasion. His play is the thing. The
theme is that of the guest who stops over in an outlying peasant hut and
is murdered in his chamber while he sleeps. Brooke added a flourish in
making the guest a returned son of the house who vanished when he was
thirteen. Taking this hackneyed idea Brooke moulded it with consummate
skill. And the result is a study in horror and pathology, vivid, artistic and
for its effect upon the audience to be compared only to the witnessing of
a child birth. Three of its actors rose to its demands. Mrs. Browne as
the lame daughter contributed practically all the human atmosphere there
was. <a id="corr-9"></a>Miriam Kiper abetted her. Allan <a id="corr-10"></a>MacDougall, in the part of a half-witted
son of a tavern keeper, added a few excellent moments. The other
men were, however, entirely unsuccessful in their efforts. Maurice Browne,
as the peasant father, failed with the rest of them to give the impression
the play demanded, sullen, grim, virile, despondency. But it was there,
despite them.
</p>

<h3 class="section" id="ANOBJECTION">
An Objection
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Why is it people have such stupid reactions to the plays put on by the
Chicago Little Theatre? I do not know. It is easy to explain why they
talk in subdued tones while entering; why they almost walk on tip-toe; why
they ask for the programs almost with awe; and why, sometimes, they stop
their chatter as the lights are slowly dimmed. The causes of these actions
and their explanation are obvious. And yet—after the play! What inane,
half-witted remarks about the bill! This “notice” printed above about the
opening bill of their fourth season—what is it worth as a piece of criticism,
as a review, or even as an account of the proceedings it so tritely and knowingly
pretends to explain? “Mrs. Browne as the lame daughter....
Miriam Kiper abetted her. MacDougall ... added a few excellent
moments.... Maurice Browne ... failed with the rest of
them.” What rot! In watching Brooke’s play you are not aware that you
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
are watching “Mrs. Browne as the lame daughter” or Miriam Kiper as
the mother, MacDougall as the son of an inn-keeper, or Mr. Browne as the
father. You do not find time to bother about that part of your reaction.
Your subjection to play and players is too strong and tense. It is the usual
thing to bother after the play, questioning members—who played this role?—who
played that role? And then, after hours or days of weighing and
shallow balancing, write a “review.” Again I question: Why do people
react so stupidly to the plays at this theatre? This is not the adequate or
honest way to view a play like Brooke’s or acting like the Little Theatre company’s.
In this play even as in <em>The Trojan Women</em> they have closely approached
that losing themselves in the “impersonal ideal” or “one tradition”
of which Mr. Powys spoke so white-heatedly in a former article in <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span>. Except for MacDougall and for Moseman, who are
<em>always</em> MacDougall and Moseman, we were watching a play—and forgot
to gather the ingredients and essentials of the inevitable review.

<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">o</span> paraphrase the biblical adage: Samson is upon ye, Philistines!
That quaint giant, Russian literature, is storming the Anglo-Saxon world;
and no longer in apothecary doses, in solitary books, but in avalanches. A
practical dreamer, Alfred A. Knopf, is determined to deluge this country
with the best and nearly best that has been written in Russia, and he is
doing it on a big scale, in torrents and showers. Such a dizzying list of
publications: Gogol, Goncharov, Lermontov, Gorky, Andreyev, Garshin,
Kropotkin; and he is going to give us Sologub, Kuzmin, Ropshin! And
he has given us <a id="corr-12"></a>Przybyszewski’s <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, the book about which I
have been drumming the ears of my American friends for years, the book
that has stirred me more than any other work of art,—I mean it literally.
Mr. Knopf has introduced another novel feature on the book-market: he
selects translators from among those who know three things—Russian,
English, and how to write,—so that the reader will be spared the torture
of wading through a badly-done translation from the French version of
a German translation from the Russian (examples? Recall <em>Sanine</em>!).
</p>

<p>
A literature is like a people; if you want to know it, you must learn not
only its Cromwells and Napoleons, but also its Asquiths and Vivianis; not
only its Shakespeares and Goethes, but its Wellses and Sudermanns as
well. Turgenyev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, do not exhaust Russian literature
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
of the nineteenth century, though they are the greatest novelists of their
epoch. There are many interesting sides of Russian life which are not
reflected on the canvasses of the great Trio, but have been painted by perhaps
minor artists, whom we cannot afford to miss if we intend to gain a
clear vista of that peculiar life and its peculiar literature.
</p>

<p>
Hence Goncharov and his <em>Precipice</em>. In Russia he is ranked next to
Turgenyev. Without the latter’s delicate lyricism Goncharov presents the
objective artist, if this is possible, in depicting the life of the gentry, the
class that has been either ignored or caricatured by the writers with a
<em>Tendenz</em>. In <em>Precipice</em> we face Rayski, Vyera, the grandmother, the passing
types of the romantic nobility, whose passions and tragedies are as
stirring and as human as those of the more democratic elements of society.
</p>

<p>
Garshin is another writer heretofore unknown to the English world.
His <em>Signal and other Stories</em> are achingly Russian. Garshin is a product of
the Eighties, the epoch of “petty deeds,” when the heavy boot of Alexander
III. drove into the underground all that was idealistic in his country. The
soil-less <em>Intelligentzia</em> had the alternative of turning retrogrades or going
insane. Garshin’s lot was with the latter category. His few stories ache
with the black melancholy which finally hurled him down a flight of stone
steps,—his last flight. His war impressions are gripping with the resigned
Russian sadness; they are all-human, universal; but <em>Attalea Princeps</em>, the
symbolical tale of an exotic plant chafing in a hot-house—who but a compatriot
of mad Garshin will fathom its profound tragicness!
</p>

<p>
The republication of Kropotkin’s <em>Ideals and Realities in Russian Literature</em>
will be of service to the critical student of Russian literature. I say
critical, for although the book is rich in material the personal views of the
author and his valuations of the writers are considerably obsolete and
tainted with the liberalistic tendency of “problem”-friends.
</p>

<p>
Below are more reviews of Mr. Knopf’s publications. The most important
one is Przybyszewski’s <em>Homo Sapiens</em>. It deserves a special article.

Homo Monstrosus
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Taras Bulba, by Nicolai Gogol. New York: Alfred A. Knopf.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
They burned him at the stake, bound to a great tree in iron chains.
The flames lapped at his feet, glowing into his old face that was scarred
and leathered with battle, brightening the silver of his fierce mustache....
</p>

<p>
Out of the reddened shadows that fell over him like a mantle his lips
could be seen curling in a smile, contemptuous and arrogant, and he turned
his eyes toward the Dnyeper where the boats of his brothers were pulling
away under a rain of lead.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
“Farewell, comrades,” he shouted to them; “remember me, and come
hither again next spring to make merry!”
</p>

<p>
And then he turned to the Lyakhs against whom he had waged war
and who knew him as the raven of the steppe.
</p>

<p>
The fire had risen above the faggots and the great tree was burning.
Out of the flames came the voice of the hero....
</p>

<p>
“A Tzar shall arise from the Russian soil and there shall not be a
Power in the world which shall not submit to him.”
</p>

<p>
Thus died Taras Bulba, kazak.
</p>

<p>
In this day when a man’s skin is his most greedily guarded possession
and the lisping of pale, pretty words his greatest glory, Taras Bulba comes
charging into America, a figure in need. On his black horse he comes, his
scalp lock flying in the wind, his sword waving in great circles above his
head, his body leaning over the shining neck of his steed and his voice
ringing with the battle whoop of the kazak.
</p>

<p>
He is the eternal warrior, the plundering hero, the lusty knight of
battle, a devil of a man with boiling blood in his veins and the savage joy
of life in his heart.
</p>

<p>
Taras and his two sons, Andrii and Ostap, go thundering up and down
the Russian steppe with the savage avalanche of the Zaporozhe. They
fight and carouse and their deeds are mighty—mightier than the deeds of
which Homer sang and the performances which Walter Scott sketched.
Beside Taras Ivanhoe pales into tin puppet, Ulysses into a lady’s man.
</p>

<p>
What a book!
</p>

<p>
If you know Gogol through his <em>Dead Souls</em>, the “humorous” classic
of Russia, you will read in amazement his <em>Taras Bulba</em>. It is Rabelais with
a sword. Through its pages ring the shouts of battle and Gargantuan
manhood—Homo Monstrosus....
</p>

<p>
Once or twice the pale face of a woman peeps out of them and Gogol
kicks it back into place with his kazak boot.
</p>

<p>
“Do you want fire, Ostap? Do you want mad blood in your heart?
Come ride with me over the steppe to the tents of the Zaporozhe....”
</p>

<p>
When I closed the book with its red shouts still ringing in my ears—with
old Taras still burning against the great tree and the magic steppe
stretching before me—I thought of the baby-ribbon bards and the querulous
quibblers of American letters—and smiled....
</p>

<p>
Come on, Bulba, there is still blood in America that has not dried, there
are still hearts that have not been transformed into pink doilies.
</p>

<p>
Welcome! You can’t shout too loud for me, you can’t swagger too
much. The soul of you that left your burning body laughed and roared its
way into heaven....

Gorky at His Best and Worst
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Chelkash, and Other Stories, by Maxim Gorky. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Maxim Gorky is the poorest and most uneven of the Russian writers.
He is—or was—a pioneer. He came wailing from lonely roads where the
vagrom man sleeps beneath the stars and wonders what there is to life.
And his dull, bitter plaints with ferocity as their leit motif soon sounded
over the world. When the majority of Russian genius was struggling to
“go to the people” Gorky had the advantage of coming from the people.
</p>

<p>
Alfred Knopf’s collection of Gorky tales under the title of <em>Chelkash</em> is
Gorky at his best and worst. I find in it some of his best tales abominably
written, studded with crass “gems” of philosophy, broken up with unnecessary
moralizings. For instance, his <em>Twenty-Six of Us and One Other</em>. In
this Gorky writes of his immortal bakeshop. As a youth Gorky spent his
days in a bakeshop. Time and again he has painted it, in other stories better
than in this one. But in this instance the bakeshop is only a background;
usually it is the main theme. Tanya, a little girl, stops every morning to
say “Hello” to the twenty-six bakers. They give her little cakes. She is
the only “ray of sweetness” in their lives. They look upon her as a daughter,
a shrine. And Tanya it is who alone awakens in them for a few
moments each day something approaching fineness. Along comes a terrible
dandy, a ladies’ man. He seduces every lady he sets his cap for; it is his
boast. The bakers like him: he is a “gentleman” and very democratic. But
one day when he is boasting the head baker grows excited and mentions
“Tanya.” The dandy boasts he will seduce her. An argument follows.
After a month the dandy succeeds. The bakers witness the girl’s “undoing.”
When she comes out of the dandy’s room, smiling, happy, they gather
around her, spit at her, revile and abuse her. No names they can think
of are bad enough. They fall into a frenzy of vituperation. But they do
not strike her. Realizing dully that a “god” has died, they go back to work.
</p>

<p>
<em>Chelkash</em>, the first tale in the book, is Gorky on his “home ground”—the
vagrom man, the pirate, the road thief. He paints him with a careful
brush and a sureness of his subject. In <em>The Steppe</em> he does the same. <em>A
Rolling Stone</em>, and <em>Chums</em>, the last the best story in the volume, are also
variations of the vagrom man theme—the underdog. But it is in stories
like <em>One Autumn Night</em>, <em>Comrades</em>, <em>The Green Kitten</em>, and <em>Her Lover</em> that
Gorky reveals his greatest genius and his greatest weakness. He can feel
them, imagine them, see them, but for some reason he cannot write them.
<em>One Autumn Night</em> might have been one of the world’s strongest classics.
</p>

<p>
All the tales in the volume are the work of the “first” Gorky—the bitter
one, the melodramatic, outraged Gorky. They are on a whole not as
good as the collection of stories written during that same period and translated
in a volume called <em>Orloff and His Wife</em>. Gorky still lives and he has
learned how to write. His later tales, composed in Italy by the “second”
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
Gorky, the consumptive, contemplative, clear-seeing Gorky, are mature,
almost mellow. But they are no longer distinctive. Anyone could have
written them, anyone with a bit of genius and a great deal of time on his
hands. But the <em>Chelkash</em> tales and the tales in <em>Orloff and His Wife</em>—these
no one but Gorky has written, and although they are inferior in workmanship
to the products of Chekhov and Andreyev the American reader will
find them perhaps more interesting.

Two Masters and a Petty Monster
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Little Angel, by Leonid Andreyev. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf.</em>
</p>

<p class="book">
<em>Russian Silhouettes, by Anton Chekhov. New York:
Charles Scribner’s Sons.</em>

<p class="book">
<em>The Breaking Point, by Michael Artzibashef. New York:
B. W. Huebsch.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
“Charming fellows, those Russians,” said my friend. “When it comes
to delineating the processes, mental and physical, of rape, suicide, incest,
arson, butchery, and disease, they are without peers....” I therefore
take this occasion to hurl two newly translated Russian books at my friend,
hoping they land on his thick head.
</p>

<p>
The first book which I hurl at my friend is Andreyev’s <em>The Little
Angel</em>. It is a collection of short stories. There are fifteen stories in the
new volume brought out by Mr. Alfred Knopf, and all of them are little
masterpieces. There is one story about a dog, <em>Snapper</em>. Only Anatole
France has equaled it. There is another story, <em>The Marseillaise</em>. It is a
perfect story. It is Kipling at his very best plus a flavor, a note, a something
serious and deep that the Russians alone know how to command, that
Kipling never reached. There is one story, <em>In the Basement</em>. I hope my
friend chokes on this story. It would serve him right.
</p>

<p>
But <em>The Little Angel</em> stands out from the fifteen. It is about a little
boy, a bitter, lonely-hearted fellow whose mother drinks and beats him,
whose father is dying of consumption, and who in turn snarls and bullies
his playmates and weeps at night because his heart is so empty and heavy.
In this story Andreyev attains a poignant delicacy of touch and a grim
beauty which even his one-time contemporary Chekhov never surpassed.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Little Angel</em> is the most beautiful short story I ever have read.
</p>

<p>
Chekhov has also been translated again. A collection of fragments,
vibrating episodes, moods, and exquisite children stories called <em>Russian
Silhouettes</em> has been issued by Scribners’.
</p>

<p>
A better artist than Andreyev, keener, more reserved, more subtle,
Chekhov to my notion nevertheless lacks the vibrancy which the author of
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
<em>The Seven Who Were Hanged</em> flings into his tales. Andreyev wields the
pen of Dostoevsky with a little thinner ink. Chekhov is Turgenev fragmentized.
He has left behind him a series of little canvases so finely done,
so skilfully passionate ... well, I hurl him at my friend without
further ado....
</p>

<p>
... It is that consumptive rogue of an Artzibashef who has caused
most of the trouble. The devil take him and his erotic suicides. His latest
translated book brought out by Huebsch is a tasteless joke. It is called
<em>The Breaking Point</em>. In it all the characters but one commit suicide, all
the women are “ruined.” Whenever two or more of its genial personae
come together they forthwith fall into an argument concerning the futility
of life, the idiocy of existence and so on and so on. And the trouble is that
Artzibashef can write, beautifully, keenly, and sometimes gloriously. In
<em>Sanine</em>, for instance, in <em>The Millionaire</em>, there are passages better than
Andreyev, better than Chekhov, better than any writer has written. But
the books are distorted, full of puerile moralizings, breathing a diseased
lust and a sentimentalized violence—and <em>The Breaking Point</em> is the worst
of them to date. Artzibashef’s work stands in the same relation to the
Russian realism that Paul De Kock’s work stands to the French sensual
finesse.

THE PASSIONATE CRIME
</p>

<p class="h3 adh">
BY E. TEMPLE THURSTON,
</p>

<p class="u ads">
Author of “The Open Window,”<br />
“The City of Beautiful<br />
Nonsense,” Etc.
</p>

<p>
This latest of Mr. E. Temple Thurston’s
novels introduces its author into
an entirely new field. Among the wilds
of Ireland, in a region of the most imaginative
superstition, he tracks down the
story of the romantic life and death of
a young poet, whose brilliantly promising
career was wrecked in the midst
of tragedy. The spirit of faerie hangs
over the whole tale, which is imbued
with Celtic glamor, and the strange, elusive
inspiration of the Irish mountainside.

Violette is an ardent creature, more alive than most people, giving herself

DEAD SOULS
</p>

<p class="ada">
By Nikolai Gogol
</p>

<p class="ads">
<em>With an Introduction by Stephen Graham</em>
</p>

<p>
“Dead Souls,” written by Gogol in the years
1837-8 is the greatest humorous novel in the Russian
language. It is the most popular book in
Russia, and its appeal is world-wide.
</p>

<p>
“‘Dead Souls’ is Russia herself. The characters
have become national types, and are more
alluded to by Russians than Mr. Pickwick, Squire
Western, Falstaff, Micawber, are by us.”—From
preface by Stephen Graham.

THE BLACK MONK<br />
THE KISS<br />

</p>

<p class="ada">
By Anton Tchekhoff
</p>

<p class="ads">
<em>Translated from the Russian by
R. E. C. Long and Adeline Lister Kaye</em>
</p>

<p>
Tchekhoff is regarded in his own country
as the most talented of the younger Russian
writers. Tolstoy has compared him to De
Maupassant. His writings have gone
through numberless editions in Russia, but
two of the above volumes are translated
into English for the first time.
</p>

<p>
His art is noted for its simplicity, shades
of psychological insight and subtle humor.
In his stories is that spirit of permanence
which lives mainly in the Past and the Future,
and so truly represents the spirit of
Russia.
</p>

<p>
“Tchekhoff is a true impressionist in the
large sense of the word. His aim is less
to divert by a tale, than to plunge one body
and soul into a given environment.”

¶ Eugene Witla is one of those strange personalities
which occasionally spring up among the humdrum types
of common life, an exotic flower in a vegetable garden.
Brilliant, irregular, unstable, he attracts and repels in
the book as in life. The story deals with his rise as
an artist, and later as a business man.
</p>

<p>
¶ He is one of those powerful and yet fragile personalities
to whom great success and great disaster almost
inevitably come. His weakness lies in the insatiable
hunger of his mind and body for the charm of feminine
youth and beauty. His conquests form a series of fascinating
episodes, gay with all the colors of love and art.
</p>

<p>
¶ Eugene is in search of the “Impossible She.” When
he is at the height of his success, he finds her. He
reaches out his arms to grasp her, and at that moment
the whole structure of his life crumbles beneath him.
Abysses open, at the bottom of which lie all but insanity.
He struggles to save himself. At the end of
the book—but read it.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
